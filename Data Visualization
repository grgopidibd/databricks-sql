Choropleth
Markers
Dashboards
Parameterized Queries
Funnel visualization
Boxplot


---The Counter

The Counter visualization is one of the simplest visualizations in Databricks SQL. It displays a single number by default, but it can 
also be configured to display a "goal" number. 

--The Bar Chart

One of the most often used visualizations in data analytics is the Bar Chart. Databricks SQL supports an variety of customization 
options to make bar charts look beautiful.

---The Stacked Bar Chart
We can glean more data from the same query by adding a second visualization.

--Maps - Choropleth

Databricks SQL has two map visualizations you can use to plot address and geolocation data: choropleth and markers. The choropleth map visualization uses color to show the count of a criterion within a specific geographic area. 

--Maps - Markers

The Map (Markers) visualization type plots points on a map that signify a specific location. e.g we have latitude and 
longitude data for our customer locations. We will use this to plot those locations on a map.

--Dashboards

We are now going to combine all the visualizations we created above into a dashboard that will display them all at once and that we can 
put on a refresh schedule to keep the data that underlies each visualization up-to-date. 

--Parameterized Queries
a customization feature we can apply to our queries to give them more flexibility. Query 
parameters allow us to make changes to our queries without requiring new code to be written.

-- Funnel visualization

The Funnel visualization shows the number of people as they progress from one step to another. e.g. the number of customers who have progressed from sales orders to actual sales.

---- Create a Boxplot

We can create a boxplot to highlight outliers in our data and to provide other information like quartiles, minimun, maximum, etc.
